# Mini Project Report – 4-bit ALU (Addition Only)

## Abstract
This project implements a 4-bit ALU that performs addition using Verilog.

## Aim
To design and simulate a 4-bit ALU capable of performing addition.

## Methodology
- Wrote ALU in Verilog  
- Created testbench  
- Simulated using ModelSim  
- Verified output waveforms  

## Result
The ALU successfully performs 4-bit addition.

## Conclusion
This project improved Verilog and digital logic understanding.
